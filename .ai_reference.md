## 📂 Files to Create (Per Day)

```
dayN/
├── README.md                    # 5-8KB, concise but complete
├── QUICK_REFERENCE.md          # 3-5KB cheat sheet
├── 00_quick_test.py            # Verification tests
├── 01_<topic>_demo.py          # 6-10 interactive demos

**README.md:**
- 5-8KB (not 27KB like original Day 1!)
- 10 main sections
- Production examples (K8s/AWS/FastAPI)
- Bad code → Good code pattern
- Include homework summary
- Link to code files

**01_demo.py:**
- 6-10 interactive demos
- Press Enter to continue between demos
- Show reference counting, memory, performance

---

## 🎯 Quality Standards

### Code Examples Must:
- Be production-ready (K8s operators, AWS automation, FastAPI services)
- Include error handling
- Show memory profiling where relevant
- Have docstrings
- Follow PEP 8

### Bad Code → Good Code Pattern:
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Explain why it fails
def bad_example():
    # Common mistake
    pass

# ✅ CORRECT - Production ready
def good_example():
    # Proper implementation
    pass
```

### Production Scenarios:
- Kubernetes operators/controllers
- AWS multi-region automation
- FastAPI microservices
- Lambda functions
- ML/AI pipelines (Week 4)
- GenAI systems (Week 4)

2. ❌ Don't use toy examples (use production K8s/AWS scenarios)
3. ❌ Don't skip benchmarks for performance claims
4. ❌ Don't forget to show bad code first
5. ❌ Don't omit CPython source file references
6. ❌ Don't create generic examples (be specific to DevOps/Backend)
7. ❌ Don't skip error handling in code examples
8. ❌ Don't forget to test the code before creating files
